# Guess-my-password

For this Password-generator challenge, I tried to keep the JS code as consolidated as possible without adding extra/unnecessary lines. 

This assignment was a code-refactor challenge, so the CSS and html files didn't need to be edited. I started with writing out Psuedocode, or an itinerary of what I needed to do in order to meet the assignment requirements. 

After I wrote out the clear objectives in my psuedocode, I created the JS outline and started to add the different functions, variables and arrays that I would need. 
I also included comments for the different functions and "if" statements, similiar to what I did in the previous challenges where I added comments for each section in the files. 

I spent quite a bit of time going through the modules and W3Schools tutorials before I started to understand the majority of the concepts in this challenge, but I enjoyed every bit of it.
